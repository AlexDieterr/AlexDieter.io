            <p>
                Hey, I’m Alex! I’m a 19-year-old college junior working toward my B.S. in Statistics and Data Science, set to graduate in just three years. I’m passionate about solving problems with data and always eager to learn new things. When I’m not diving into code, you’ll probably find me playing soccer, exploring new hiking trails, or traveling to different countries. I thrive on challenges, whether it’s in academics, sports, or personal growth, and I’m always looking for the next opportunity to push myself further.
